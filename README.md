# Silent Firebase Initialization Failure

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive Firebase initialization error. The application fails to initialize correctly, leading to silent failures in subsequent Firebase operations. This can be difficult to debug because there's no clear error message.

## Bug
The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic initialization.  The issue lies in providing either incorrect or incomplete Firebase configuration values. This often occurs when the configuration is copied from a wrong source or sensitive keys are mistyped, leading to an unsuccessful initialization.

## Solution
The `firebaseBugSolution.js` file provides a corrected initialization and includes added error handling for a more robust solution. It demonstrates how to properly handle potential errors during Firebase initialization and provides more descriptive error messages to aid debugging.
